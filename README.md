CaseFlow — Migration Case Management System

CaseFlow is a modern full-stack case management system designed for migration and visa agencies. It centralizes client information, case progress, activity logs, and communication into one clean interface. The system includes a dashboard, case list, case detail views, timeline tracking, and real-time updates powered by a Node.js + Express backend and PostgreSQL database.

Built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Docker, CaseFlow demonstrates my ability to build real business-oriented systems with clean architecture, scalable APIs, and responsive UI.

This project also includes an AI-enhancement roadmap, such as AI-generated case summaries, document checklists, email templates, and workflow automation.

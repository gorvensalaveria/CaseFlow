1) Add navigation UX (small but important)

Back to Cases link/button

Optional: show breadcrumb like Cases / Case #1

2) Loading + Error UI polish

You probably already have basic loading/error states, but later you can upgrade to:

skeleton loading

nicer error banner + retry button

3) Convert timestamps

Right now it shows a readable date/time (good). Later you can improve to:

“2 hours ago”

consistent timezone formatting
